# A political movement

This is a political party starting out in the next Parliament election in Denmark. 
At the same time also an attempt to start an international movement that wish to help spread freedom for human beings and animals through clever legislation.
Legislation that transfers legal rights and privileges from the few super rich families and multinational corporations to each individual human being. 

With deep respect for nature and the sustainability of the earth in the knowledge that there is enough resources on this planet for everyone. 
Especially if we actively start by stopping mainly multinational corporations from polluting the planet. 
And if we immediately cease all warfare, and aim to reduce and revert the arms race and close down as many military bases as possible, as fast as possible.



One of the most important components in a successful transition from the current system will be to nationalize all the privately owned or privately controlled central banks to People Owned National Banks, that issue debt free money directly to each citizen as a Citizen Dividend at a level equal to 4% of GDP (Gross Domestic Product). 



# Political vision

The political program consists of three parts:

1. The first part is representing some of the most left wing economic policy ideas.


2. The second part is representing some of the most right wing economic policy ideas.
By displaying it is possible to do all of those within a balanced budget, we are exposing the current political landscape as incompetent.

3. The third part, the remaining part and the longest part is dedicated to the Freedom of the human beings, from an oppressive growing bureuacracy on the one hand and from few rich families and multinational tax-cheating corporations on the other hand.

What we have now is a strong oppressive government and few very influential corporations and thus by definition we have fascism. What we will have instead is human freedom. Free of usury, income tax, pollution and war. In short a life in prosperity, creativity, health, welfare and nurture.
